# SFRPG Encountergen

The entire module was made while listening to the fantastic Starfinder actual play podcast Southern Tomfoolery. <3

Once the module is activated, there's a new button at the bottom of the Actor directory. 

1. Click the Generate Encounter button. 
2. Set the expected difficulty in the drop-down menu. 
3. Enter the party's Average Party Level (the party's total level divided by party size). 
4. Click Random encounter.
5. If you want more information, click the NPC name to open the sheet.
6. If you're unhappy with a specific NPC, click the reroll button on its list to get another NPC of the same CR.
7. Reroll until satisfied.
8. Click import. They're added to the bottom of the encounter directory.

## Known issues
Very low (below 0) and very high CR (above 23) will occasionally give empty lines. Reroll. If it keeps happening, try a more reasonable CR.

Encounter difficulty and APL resets, to easy and blank respectively, on the window when Random encounter or reroll is clicked. The module knows what setting you chose, but it's pretty annoying. Unfortunately(?), it's just not quite as annoying as fixing it would be right now.
